JK Python extensions
====================

* Stark energy calculation
  - provide tool for merging files
  - use sparse matrices (i.e., using pysparse)
  - parallelize by calculating individual Ms/fields separately and merging them afterwards


* general
  - implement molecular beam source simulations
  - implement trajectory calculations
  - provide analysis tools for phase-space distributions
