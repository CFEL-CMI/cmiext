* Prerequisites 

The extension package rests on the shoulders of giants, i.e., you need
a recent Python 2.x system and some other important Python packages,
including (but not necessarily limited to)
  - numpy
  - pytables

These requirements can all be met by using the Enthought Python
Distribution, for example.


* Installation

Adminstrator installation:
    python setup.py install --home=$HOME/.python

In order to install this extension module in user-space, run
    python setup.py install --home=$HOME/.python
and set your environment up for python to find it:
    setenv PYTHONPATH $HOME/.python/lib/python
